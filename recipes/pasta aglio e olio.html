    <p>Spaghetti aglio e olio translates to “spaghetti with garlic and oil.” The traditional dish contains little more than these ingredients. It might be finished with a sprinkle of parsley or a pinch of red pepper flakes, but even these are optional. In its simplest form, this classic Italian pasta features spaghetti, olive oil, garlic, salt, and pepper.</p>
    <p>It comes together in just 20 minutes, it uses a handful of pantry ingredients, and it’s simply delicious. If you have pasta, garlic, and olive oil in your kitchen,</p>
    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>spaghetti</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>garlic</li>
        <li>parsley</li>
        <li>chili</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pan of well-salted water to the boil and cook the spaghetti for about 10 mins, or until al dente. It should retain a little bite.</li>
        <li>When the pasta is nearly ready, heat the oil in a frying pan set over a medium heat and sizzle the garlic and chilli, if using, for 1 minute until fragrant and the garlic is lightly golden but not brown (the garlic will taste bitter if it gets too dark).</li>
        <li>Drain the spaghetti and add it to the garlicky oil with the parsley. Season and toss to combine, then serve.</li>
    </ol>
