    <p>Pesto or more fully pesto alla genovese is a paste made of crushed garlic, pine nuts, salt, basil leaves, grated cheese such as Parmesan or pecorino sardo, and olive oil. It originated in the Italian city of Genoa, and is used to dress pasta and flavour genoese minestrone soup</p>
    <p>The name pesto is the past participle of the Genoese verb pest√† (Italian: pestare), meaning 'to pound', 'to crush': the ingredients are "crushed" or ground in a marble mortar through a circular motion of a wooden pestle. The same Latin root gives us pestle. There are other foods called pesto, but pesto by itself usually means pesto alla genovese.</p>
    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>spaghetti</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>basil leaves</li>
        <li>pine nuts</li>
        <li>pecorino romano</li>
        <li>parmigiano reggiano</li>
        <li>garlic</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pick the basil leaves, remember not to wash them under running water, but clean them with a soft cloth, or place them in a bowl of cold water and rinse delicately. Now place the peeled garlic in the mortar, together with a few grains of coarse salt. Start grinding and upon obtaining a garlic cream</li>
        <li>Add the basil leaves along with a pinch of coarse salt. Crush the basil leaves against the sides of the mortar by rolling the pestle left to right and rolling the mortar in the opposite direction (right to left); continue to coax a green liquid from the basil leaves.</li>
        <li>Now add the pine nuts and crush into a cream. Gradually add the cheese for an even creamier sauce, and then last of all, gradually add the extravirgin olive oil, stirring with the pestle all the while.</li>
        <li>Thoroughly amalgamate all the ingredients into a homogeneous sauce. Bring abundant salted water to the boil in a saucepan and cook the pasta. Now place the pesto in a large pan (remove from the heat) and temper with a little pasta cooking water.</li>
        <li>Stir with a spatula and as soon as the pasta is ready, add it straight to the pesto</li>
        <li>stir to flavor the dish and lastly, serve your spaghetti col pesto garnished with a few basil leaves.</li>
    </ol>
